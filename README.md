# Documentation Web-Essentials 📚

🌍 Welcome to my Web-Essentials repository! This collection includes a series of tasks and exercises in HTML and JavaScript I have completed as part of my web development training. While these foundational assignments focus on essential concepts, which are crucial for building a solid understanding of web technologies, they are not sufficient on their own to create a fully functional website. However, they serve as an important starting point, igniting a passion for web programming and paving the way for further development in the field 💡.

The repository is organized into three main sections:
- 📄 **HTML Basics**: This section features tasks that demonstrate the core principles of HTML, including structure and elements. Each exercise can help to reinforce the understanding of how to effectively use HTML in web development.
- 📜 **JS Basics**: Here, you will find exercises that cover the basics of JavaScript, such as variables, arrays and functions. These foundational tasks are essential for any aspiring developer to grasp the language.
- 💻 **JS Fundamentals**: This section delves deeper into JavaScript concepts, introducing essential topics like Objects and Classes and Regular Expressions.

## 📂 JS Basics
📖 This section contains a variety of exercises designed to introduce you to the basic principles of JavaScript. Each task focuses on key concepts, providing a solid foundation for writing JavaScript code.
